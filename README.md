Data Science & Python Journey using Jupyter
Established: July 2025

This repository contains a collection of my Jupyter Notebook files. I am using this space to document my progress and projects as I learn and grow in the field of data science using Python and Jupyter.

Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:

Store and organize my data science projects and exercises.

Track my learning path and the new skills I acquire.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for all projects.

Anaconda: The distribution platform for Python, used for package management and deployment.

Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment for writing and sharing code, visualizations, and narrative text.

Key Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and others as I explore different areas of data science.

Feel free to explore the notebooks to see my journey!
